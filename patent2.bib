<p>The maize genome contains abundant repeats interspersed by low-copy, gene-coding sequences that make it a challenge to sequence; consequently, current BAC sequence assemblies average 11 contigs per clone. The iMap deals with such complexity by the judicious integration of IBM genetic and B73 physical maps, but the B73 genome structure could differ from the IBM population because of genetic recombination and subsequent rearrangements. Accordingly, we report a genome-wide, high-resolution optical map of maize B73 genome that was constructed from the direct analysis of genomic DNA molecules without using genetic markers. The integration of optical and iMap resources with comparisons to FPC maps enabled a uniquely comprehensive and scalable assessment of a given BAC's sequence assembly, its placement within a FPC contig, and the location of this FPC contig within a chromosome-wide pseudomolecule. As such, the overall utility of the maize optical map for the validation of sequence assemblies has been significant and demonstrates the inherent advantages of single molecule platforms. Construction of the maize optical map represents the first physical map of a eukaryotic genome larger than 400 Mb that was created <italic>de novo</italic> from individual genomic DNA molecules.</p>

ABSTRACT = {While new sequencing technologies have ushered in an era where microbial genomes can be easily sequenced, the goal of routinely producing high-quality draft and finished genomes in a cost-effective fashion has still remained elusive. Due to shorter read lengths and limitations in library construction protocols, shotgun sequencing and assembly based on these technologies often results in fragmented assemblies. Correspondingly, while draft assemblies can be obtained in days, finishing can take many months and hence the time and effort can only be justified for high-priority genomes and in large sequencing centers. In this work, we revisit this issue in light of our own experience in producing finished and nearly-finished genomes for a range of microbial species in a small-lab setting. These genomes were finished with surprisingly little investments in terms of time, computational effort and lab work, suggesting that the increased access to sequencing might also eventually lead to a greater proportion of finished genomes from small labs and genomics cores.}

description of the transcription units. While this information at its nest level is not often available,

information from signicantly coarser descriptions that are easily available in genomic maps. Such
maps with high resolution and accuracy as well as partially assembled sequences at various degrees

In general, genetically or physically mapped collections of objects derived from the genome under

consistency and integration. The integrated genomic databases derived from all available sources are
likely to prove useful even at an early stage for annotation, gap detection (in sequences) and targeted

@article{autofinish,
    abstract = {{Currently, the genome sequencing community is producing shotgun sequence data at a very high rate, but finishing (collecting additional directed sequence data to close gaps and improve the quality of the data) is not matching that rate. One reason for the difference is that shotgun sequencing is highly automated but finishing is not: Most finishing decisions, such as which directed reads to obtain and which specialized sequencing techniques to use, are made by people. If finishing rates are to increase to match shotgun sequencing rates, most finishing decisions also must be automated. The Autofinish computer program (which is part of the computer software package) does this by automatically choosing finishing reads. Autofinish is able to suggest most finishing reads required for completion of each sequencing project, greatly reducing the amount of human attention needed. sometimes completely finishes the project, with no human decisions required. It cannot solve the most complex problems, so we recommend that Autofinish be allowed to suggest reads for the first three rounds of finishing, and if the project still is not finished completely, a human finisher complete the work. We compared this Autofinish-Hybrid method of finishing against a human finisher in five different projects with a variety of shotgun depths by finishing each project twice--once with each method. This comparison shows that the Autofinish-Hybrid method saves many hours over a human finisher alone, while using roughly the same number and type of reads and closing gaps at roughly the same rate. Autofinish currently is in production use at several large sequencing centers. It is designed to be adaptable to the finishing strategy of the lab--it can finish using some or all of the following: resequencing reads, reverses, custom primer walks on either subclone templates or whole clone templates, PCR, or minilibraries. Autofinish has been used for finishing cDNA, genomic clones, and whole bacterial genomes (see http://www.phrap.org).}},

@electronic{dupfinisher,
    abstract = {{Currently, the genome sequencing community is producing shotgun sequence data at a very high rate, but genome finishing is not keeping pace, even with the help from several automated finishing tools, such as autoFinish. One reason for the slow progress in finishing is that repetitive regions longer than the length of a sequencing read cannot be assembled correctly with many current assembly tools. Therefore, most repeat regions have to be checked manually. If finishing rates are to increase further, most repetitive regions must be assembled correctly and be finished in an automated fashion. The Dupfinisher computer program is designed to finish repeats with minimal human interaction. It can automatically detect repetitive regions, assemble each repeat individually using paired draft reads and primer walk reads, check the quality of these subassemblies, create artificial joins for finished and properly assembled repeats and run automated gap closure scripts on unfinished subassemblies. Dupfinisher is able to solve the majority of repeats in a microbial genome automatically, thus greatly reducing the amount of human attention needed. Dupfinisher has now been used in finishing more than 60 genomes and can be adapted to aid in finishing processes for whole bacterial genome and large insert clone projects.}},

@article{finishingvertebrates,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:The approaches for shotgun-based sequencing of vertebrate genomes are now well-established, and have resulted in the generation of numerous draft whole-genome sequence assemblies. In contrast, the process of refining those assemblies to improve contiguity and increase accuracy (known as 'sequence finishing') remains tedious, labor-intensive, and expensive. As a result, the vast majority of vertebrate genome sequences generated to date remain at a draft stage.RESULTS:To date, our genome sequencing efforts have focused on comparative studies of targeted genomic regions, requiring sequence finishing of large blocks of orthologous sequence (average size 0.5-2 Mb) from various subsets of 75 vertebrates. This experience has provided a unique opportunity to compare the relative effort required to finish shotgun-generated genome sequence assemblies from different species, which we report here. Importantly, we found that the sequence assemblies generated for the same orthologous regions from various vertebrates show substantial variation with respect to misassemblies and, in particular, the frequency and characteristics of sequence gaps. As a consequence, the work required to finish different species' sequences varied greatly. Application of the same standardized methods for finishing provided a novel opportunity to "assay" characteristics of genome sequences among many vertebrate species. It is important to note that many of the problems we have encountered during sequence finishing reflect unique architectural features of a particular vertebrate's genome, which in some cases may have important functional and/or evolutionary implications. Finally, based on our analyses, we have been able to improve our procedures to overcome some of these problems and to increase the overall efficiency of the sequence-finishing process, although significant challenges still remain.CONCLUSION:Our findings have important implications for the eventual finishing of the draft whole-genome sequences that have now been generated for a large number of vertebrates.}},

    abstract = {{Recent developments in sequencing technologies have given the opportunity to sequence many bacterial genomes with limited cost and labor, compared to previous techniques. However, a limiting step of genome sequencing is the finishing process, needed to infer the relative position of each contig and close sequencing gaps. An additional degree of complexity is given by bacterial species harboring more than one replicon, which are not contemplated by the currently available programs. The availability of a large number of bacterial genomes allows geneticists to use complete genomes (possibly from the same species) as templates for contigs mapping.Here we present CONTIGuator, a software tool for contigs mapping over a reference genome which allows the visualization of a map of contigs, underlining loss and/or gain of genetic elements and permitting to finish multipartite genomes. The functionality of CONTIGuator was tested using four genomes, demonstrating its improved performances compared to currently available programs.Our approach appears efficient, with a clear visualization, allowing the user to perform comparative structural genomics analysis on draft genomes. CONTIGuator is a Python script for Linux environments and can be used on normal desktop machines and can be downloaded from http://contiguator.sourceforge.net webcite.}},
